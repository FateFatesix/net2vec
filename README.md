Extended results and code explanation supporting paper *Message-Passing Neural Networks Learn Little's Law* by Krzysztof Rusek and Piotr Chołda are avalable at in the notebook  [LittlesLaw](jupyter_notebooks/LittlesLaw.ipynb).
In [mpnn](mpnn) we provide a TensorFlow implementation of neural message passing architecture described in the paper.
