# net2vec

This repository is a collection of machine learning models for computer networks.

## mpnn

Extended results and code explanation supporting paper *Message-Passing Neural Networks Learn Little's Law* by Krzysztof Rusek and Piotr Chołda are avalable at in the notebook  [LittlesLaw](jupyter_notebooks/LittlesLaw.ipynb).
In [mpnn](mpnn) we provide a TensorFlow implementation of neural message passing architecture described in the paper.


**If you decide to apply the concepts presented or base on the provided code, please do refer our paper: Krzysztof Rusek and Piotr Chołda, ''Message-Passing Neural Networks Learn Little's Law'', IEEE Communications Letters, 2018, *accepted for publication*.**

## routenet

RouteNet is a neural architecture for network performance evaluation first proposed in the paper *Unveiling the potential of GNN for network modeling and optimization in SDN* by K. Rusek, J. Suárez-Varela, A. Mestres, P. Barlet-Ros, A. Cabellos-Aparicio accepted for ACM Symposium on SDN Research, April 2019, San Jose, CA, USA.

Imlementation is provided in  [routenet](routenet).
